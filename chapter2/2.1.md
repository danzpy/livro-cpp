<h5>What are the differences between int, long, long long,
and short?</h5>

- The differences between them is the size and range.

  Type        | Minimum Size | Minimum Number Range
  ------------|--------------|--------------------------------
  `int`       | 16 bits      | -32767 ~ +32767
  `long`      | 32 bits      | -2,147,483,647 ~ +2,147,483,647
  `long long` | 64 bits      | -9.22 * 10^18 ~ +9.22 * 10^18
  `short`     | 16 bits      | -32767 ~ +32767



<h5>Between an unsigned and a signed type?</h5>

- Signed types can be represented by negative and positive numbers (including zero). And unsigned can only be positive numbers  (including zero).

<h5>Between a float and
a double?</h5>

- The difference is the size and the precision floating points.
